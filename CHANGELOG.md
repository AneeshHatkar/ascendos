## 2026-06-19 23:35 UTC — Phase 6 Safe Write Plan Started

Added the Phase 6 plan for the Safe Write / Proposed Action Flow.

This starts the controlled write foundation for ascendOS:
- proposed actions
- validation
- Save/Edit/Cancel confirmation
- server-side writes
- audit logging
- timeline linkage
- dashboard refresh

No runtime write code was added yet.

## 2026-06-19 23:44 UTC — Added Proposed Action Type Registry

Added the Phase 6 proposed action type registry.

This establishes the first safe-write foundation layer by defining which action names are allowed before contracts, validation, lifecycle, execution, and UI are added.\n\n## 2026-06-19 23:51 UTC — Added Proposed Action Contracts

Added typed proposed action contracts for Phase 6 safe write flows.

Supported contracts:
- create task
- create goal
- create daily log
- create proof item

This prepares the project for validation and controlled action execution.\n

## 2026-06-19 23:58 UTC — Added Action Result Types

Added standard action result contracts for Phase 6 safe-write workflows.

This prepares validation and execution code to return consistent success/error objects instead of ad hoc values.

## 2026-06-20 00:05 UTC — Added Proposed Action Payload Validation

Added proposed action validation for Phase 6 safe-write workflows.

This prevents invalid or unsafe proposed action payloads from reaching future execution code.\n\n## 2026-06-20 00:09 UTC — Added Audit Logging Helper

Added a reusable audit logging helper for Phase 6 safe-write workflows.

This prepares future confirmed writes to create traceable audit records.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 04:31 UTC — Added Timeline Helper Boundary

Added a safe timeline helper boundary for Phase 6.

Because the current SQL spine does not include a `timeline_events` table, the helper intentionally returns a controlled skipped result instead of inventing schema or writing to a non-existent table.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 04:49 UTC — Added Proposed Action Creation Helper

Added a helper for creating validated proposed actions in `ai_actions` with `pending_confirmation` status.

This preserves the required Phase 6 flow: proposal first, confirmation later, execution only after explicit approval.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 05:05 UTC — Added Action Lifecycle Helper

Added a safe lifecycle helper for proposed actions.

The helper supports approval, rejection, cancellation, and failure marking while preserving the Phase 6 rule that target records are not written until a later explicit execution step.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 05:18 UTC — Added Execution Dispatcher Boundary

Added the Phase 6 execution dispatcher boundary.

The dispatcher verifies ownership, approval status, and action type, but intentionally does not execute target-table writes until the specific Phase 6.11–6.14 action flows are implemented.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 05:24 UTC — Added Create Task Execution Flow

Added the first concrete Phase 6 execution flow: approved `create_task` proposals can now create records in `tasks`.

The dispatcher now routes `create_task` actions to the task flow while keeping the remaining action types intentionally unimplemented until their specific phases.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 18:09 UTC — Added Create Goal Execution Flow

Added the Phase 6 create-goal execution flow: approved `create_goal` proposals can now create records in `goals`.

The dispatcher now routes `create_goal` actions to the goal flow while keeping daily logs and proof items intentionally unimplemented until their specific phases.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 18:13 UTC — Added Create Daily Log Execution Flow

Added the Phase 6 create-daily-log execution flow: approved `create_daily_log` proposals can now create records in `daily_logs`.

The dispatcher now routes `create_daily_log` actions to the daily log flow while keeping proof items intentionally unimplemented until Phase 6.14.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 18:17 UTC — Added Create Proof Item Execution Flow

Added the Phase 6 create-proof-item execution flow: approved `create_proof_item` proposals can now create records in `proof_items`.

The dispatcher now routes all four Phase 6 write action types: tasks, goals, daily logs, and proof items.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 18:22 UTC — Added Proposed Action Review UI

Added a reusable Save/Edit/Cancel UI component for reviewing proposed actions before execution.

The component supports payload preview, JSON payload editing, validation issue display, Save / Confirm callback, and Cancel callback while keeping database writes outside the component.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 18:30 UTC — Wired Proposed Action Review into Carnos Page

Wired the Phase 6 proposed-action review card into the Carnos dashboard as a safe confirmation-first preview surface.

The page now displays the Save/Edit/Cancel UI while preserving the server-owned write boundary.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 18:38 UTC — Added Phase 6 Audit Gate

Added `scripts/audit-phase-6.mjs` and wired `npm run audit:phase6` into the main check pipeline.

The audit verifies the Phase 6 safe write proposed-action flow and guards the confirmation-first boundary.\n

## 2026-06-20 18:47 UTC — Completed Phase 6 Safe Write Proposed Action Flow

Completed Phase 6 and added the final Phase 6 report.

Phase 6 now includes proposed action creation, validation, lifecycle handling, approved-only execution dispatch, four target write flows, Save/Edit/Cancel UI, Carnos page wiring, and a Phase 6 audit gate.

## Phase 7.7B - Wire Timeline Dashboard Route

- Wired the Phase 7 Timeline dashboard component into `/timeline` while preserving the existing read-only timeline records view.

## Phase 7.11 - Pending Updates / Confirmation Drawer Integration

- Added a read-only pending updates drawer to the Carnos dashboard while preserving confirmation-first action review boundaries.

## Phase 7.12 - Carnos Panel v1

- Added a read-only Carnos operating panel to the Carnos dashboard with companion state and confirmation visibility.

## Phase 7.13 - Cross-Dashboard Links

- Added canonical cross-dashboard navigation across the Phase 7 operating dashboard surfaces.

## Phase 7.14 - Empty / Loading / Error / Privacy States

- Added contract-backed dashboard card states for empty, loading, error, and privacy-redacted rendering.
