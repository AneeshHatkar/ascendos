- Added Python/ML boundary audit.
- No runtime ML, database write behavior, or existing Phase 1-5 behavior was changed.

## 2026-06-19 23:35 UTC — Phase 6 Safe Write Plan Started

Added the Phase 6 plan for the Safe Write / Proposed Action Flow.

This starts the controlled write foundation for ascendOS:
- proposed actions
- validation
- Save/Edit/Cancel confirmation
- server-side writes
- audit logging
- timeline linkage
- dashboard refresh

No runtime write code was added yet.

## 2026-06-19 23:44 UTC — Added Proposed Action Type Registry

Added the Phase 6 proposed action type registry.

This establishes the first safe-write foundation layer by defining which action names are allowed before contracts, validation, lifecycle, execution, and UI are added.\n\n## 2026-06-19 23:51 UTC — Added Proposed Action Contracts

Added typed proposed action contracts for Phase 6 safe write flows.

Supported contracts:
- create task
- create goal
- create daily log
- create proof item

This prepares the project for validation and controlled action execution.\n

## 2026-06-19 23:58 UTC — Added Action Result Types

Added standard action result contracts for Phase 6 safe-write workflows.

This prepares validation and execution code to return consistent success/error objects instead of ad hoc values.

## 2026-06-20 00:05 UTC — Added Proposed Action Payload Validation

Added proposed action validation for Phase 6 safe-write workflows.

This prevents invalid or unsafe proposed action payloads from reaching future execution code.\n\n## 2026-06-20 00:09 UTC — Added Audit Logging Helper

Added a reusable audit logging helper for Phase 6 safe-write workflows.

This prepares future confirmed writes to create traceable audit records.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 04:31 UTC — Added Timeline Helper Boundary

Added a safe timeline helper boundary for Phase 6.

Because the current SQL spine does not include a `timeline_events` table, the helper intentionally returns a controlled skipped result instead of inventing schema or writing to a non-existent table.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 04:49 UTC — Added Proposed Action Creation Helper

Added a helper for creating validated proposed actions in `ai_actions` with `pending_confirmation` status.

This preserves the required Phase 6 flow: proposal first, confirmation later, execution only after explicit approval.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 05:05 UTC — Added Action Lifecycle Helper

Added a safe lifecycle helper for proposed actions.

The helper supports approval, rejection, cancellation, and failure marking while preserving the Phase 6 rule that target records are not written until a later explicit execution step.\n\n\n## 2026-06-20 05:18 UTC — Added Execution Dispatcher Boundary

Added the Phase 6 execution dispatcher boundary.

The dispatcher verifies ownership, approval status, and action type, but intentionally does not execute target-table writes until the specific Phase 6.11–6.14 action flows are implemented.\n
